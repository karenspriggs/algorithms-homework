### Week 2:
This week I demonstrated an understanding of the Big O Notation and how it relates to the complexity of the algorithms I write. In order to do so, I have written methods that serve as examples of the following notations: O(1), O(n), and O(n^2). 

### O(1)
An algorithm with a complexity of O(1) will always take the same amount of resources to run, now matter how large the data set is. 

### O(n)
An algorithm with a complexity of O(n) has a linear relationship between the size of the data set and the amount of resources needed to run it.

### O(n^2)
An algorithm with a complexity of O(n) has an exponential relationship between the size of the data set and the amount of resources needed to run it.

Depending on what an algorithm does, it can have different best case and worse case big O notation complexity levels.
