### Week 8:
This week I learned about different data structures, including arrays, maps, queues, and stacks. I did so by creating an application that reads in data from a text file and stores it in instances of all four of those different data structures. I also included comments that explain what each data structure does, how it works, what the pros and cons are, and how they can be used.
