# PROG 336 - Algorithms Assignments
### Week 2:
This week I demonstrated an understanding of the Big O Notation and how it relates to the complexity of the algorithms I write. In order to do so, I have written methods that serve as examples of the following notations: O(1), O(n), and O(n^2). These can be found in this respository within the [Week2Assignment.cs ](https://github.com/karenspriggs/algorithms-homework/blob/main/Week2Assignment.cs) file.

### Week 5:
This week I learned about the Fisher-Yates shuffle by creating an application that utilizes it. This application reads in lines from a text file and then uses one of two possible versions of the Fisher-Yates shuffle to create a new random permutation of those elements. The Visual Studio project containing the application can be found in the following space [in this repo](https://github.com/karenspriggs/algorithms-homework/tree/main/FisherYatesShuffle).
