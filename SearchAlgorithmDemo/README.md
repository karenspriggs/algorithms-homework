# Weeks 11 and 12:
In weeks 11 and 12, I learned about searching and sorting algorithms. Since some of the searching algorithms require the data set to be sorted prior to searching, I decided to make the two in the same solution. 

## Sorting
I learned about six different sorting algorithms in week 11:

**Bubble Sort**

**Insertion Sort**

**Selection Sort**

**Heap Sort**

**Quick Sort**

**Merge Sort**

## Searching
I learned about three different sorting algorithms in week 12:

**Linear**

**Binary**

**Interpolation**
