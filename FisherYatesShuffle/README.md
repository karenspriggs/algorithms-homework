### Week 5:
This week I learned about the Fisher-Yates shuffle by creating an application that utilizes it. This application reads in lines from a text file and then uses one of two possible versions of the Fisher-Yates shuffle to create a new random permutation of those elements. 

### Fisher-Yates Shuffle
The Fisher-Yates shuffle is an algorithm that was developed in 1938, before computers as we know them were even developed. The algorithm was originally made to be executed by hand via physical cards, but it now can be used to shuffle arrays of objects in different programming languages. There are a few variants of the algorithm, of which I had implemented two of in my application: the traditional method, and the modern method made specifically for computers.
